This is a file test. 
I'm testing the 2nd part of my tutorial that consists of checking out a file from this remote repository Github to local repository. 
And from local repository to eclipse for modification. 
After modification done, I will go back to the checkin process i.e perform the Add-Commit-Push actions.

I pulled the file from remote repository to my local system. I perform some editions in from my eclipse. 
Now I am going to go through the checkin process in the remote repository.
